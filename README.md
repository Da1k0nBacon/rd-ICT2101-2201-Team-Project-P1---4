ICT2101-Team-P1-4 Robot Car Website System Project.

# Project Overview
> <p style="text-align=justify">The Robot Car Website System is intended for primary school students to use solely for education purposes. The system deployed is an online web interface where students can easily access it using desktops or laptops. This project will be a follow-on product based on products such as Lego Mindstorms, however it is improved as for example with Lego Mindstorms, the programming needs to be done via connecting to the computer via a cable while for the Robot Car Website System, programming can be done wirelessly via Wi-Fi. The online web portal will be the central interface used by students to send commands to control the movement of the robot car and receive feedback on the robot car. Feedback received will be displayed out via the web portal. Also, on the web portal a student can create a profile while there will be a teacher account that will be able to check on the studentâ€™s progress and create challenges for students to complete. <br/>

> Students must click on different car movement commands on the web portal to move the robot car successfully. Commands will then be stored on the server and sent over the internet to the car through an ESP8266 Wi-Fi serial transmitter. From the external point of view, the car's built-in sensors will detect and change according to the commands indicated by the students. The sensors will then drive the robot car to exhibit various behaviours. These behaviours will reflect on the web portal through transferring data using Wi-Fi and server. </p>
